Corpus: City Guides

# Unit 1

## What This Does

This is a question-answering system built on a corpus of city and town guides for one region — Brightwater, Halden Bay, Kestrelford, Corry Vale, Pellew Sands, and a handful of others — plus cross-cutting guides on eating, walking, seasons, transport, and accessibility. It answers specific, factual questions about the region: what to see somewhere in a given amount of time, where and what to eat, when to visit, and which places are hard to get around. Questions outside that scope, like general trivia unrelated to the region, are refused instead of guessed at.

## Chunking Strategy

**Chunk size:** 100

**Overlap:** 20

<!-- What about YOUR documents made you pick these numbers? Short posts and
     long sectioned guides don't want the same chunking, and "800 seemed
     reasonable" earns nothing. Point at something you noticed when you read
     the documents in Milestone 1.

     If you changed your mind partway through, say so and say why. That's worth
     more than pretending you got it right first time.

     Milestone 3. -->

## Sample Chunks

<!-- Five chunks, pasted as text. Label each one and name the file it came from
     AND the function that produced it — the grader checks your code against
     what you claim here.

     `python app.py chunks -n 5` prints all three for you. Copy them straight
     across.

     Milestone 3. -->

**Chunk 1** — `source`: guide_accessibility.md#0  |  `produced by`: chunker.py::split_documents

```
An honest assessment rather than a promotional one. Some of these places are difficult and it is better to know in advance.
```

**Chunk 2** — `source`: guide_corry_vale.md#5  |  `produced by`: chunker.py::split_documents

```
Corry Vale Where to stay

Perhaps thirty beds in the entire valley, spread across two pubs and a handful of farmhouse rooms. In summer these are booked months ahead. Camping is permitted on two marked fields and nowhere else.
```

**Chunk 3** — `source`: guide_givens_mill.md#2  |  `produced by`: chunker.py::split_documents

```
Kestrelford What to see

The market square on a Saturday morning is the main event and has run continuously since the 1400s. The parish church has a 13th-century tower you can climb for £2. The old trackbed walk runs six miles to the next village along an easy gradient and is the best half-day here.
```

**Chunk 4** — `source`: guide_kestrelford.md#4  |  `produced by`: chunker.py::split_documents

```
Pellew Sands When to go

June and September for the beach without the crowds. July and August are busy and the town is at its most itself, for better and worse. Winter is bleak, largely closed, and has a following among people who like that sort of thing.

## Sample Answer

<!-- One complete question and answer, pasted as text, with the source line
     visible. Milestone 4. -->

**Question:** 

What to see under 2 hours in Brightwater?

**Answer:**

```
Based on the provided documents (`guide_brightwater.md`), the sights that take under two hours to see are:

* **The mill museum:** This takes about 90 minutes.
* **The 14th-century cathedral:** This takes about 20 minutes. 

*(Note: The river walk runs four miles upstream, but a specific time duration is not listed for it.)*

Sources retrieved: guide_brightwater.md
```

**My relevance cutoff:**

THRESHOLD = 0.6. The five in-corpus questions came back with distances between 0.3350 and 0.6042; the five OUT_OF_SCOPE questions came back between 0.8110 and 0.9991. That's a clear gap from about 0.60 to 0.81, and 0.6 sits right at its near edge — close enough that one in-corpus question ("Where in the region has difficult accessibility?", 0.6042) lands just barely on the wrong side of it. A cutoff nearer the middle of the gap, around 0.65–0.7, would keep that question in-scope while still refusing every OUT_OF_SCOPE question with room to spare.

<!-- The number you set in config.py, and how you got there.

     You ran five questions your corpus covers and the five in OUT_OF_SCOPE
     that it clearly doesn't, and wrote down the best distance for each. What
     did those two groups look like? Where was the gap? Put the actual numbers
     here — the table below wants all ten rows.

     Milestone 4. -->

| Question | In corpus? | Best distance |
|---|---|---|
| Where can people find good cooking in this region? | Yes | 0.5999 |
| What to see under 2 hours in Brightwater? | Yes | 0.3975 |
| Where should students visit during the summer? | Yes | 0.4656 |
| What should students eat when visiting Halden Bay? | Yes | 0.3350 |
| Where in the region has difficult accessibility? | Yes | 0.6042 |
| What is the capital of Mongolia? | No | 0.8110 |
| How do I change the oil in a diesel engine? | No | 0.8797 |
| Who won the 1994 World Cup? | No | 0.9991 |
| What is the recommended dosage of ibuprofen for a headache? | No | 0.8409 |
| How do I write a for loop in Rust? | No | 0.8776 |

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. For each: what you asked for, what came back, and
     what you changed about it.

     "I asked Claude to write the chunking function from my notes. It ignored
     the overlap, so I added that myself" is the level of detail we're after.
     "I used AI to help me code" is not.

     Milestone 5. -->

**1.** I asked Claude to help guide me through the `split_documents` part since I did not know where to start. I wrote me 3 TODOs and I filled them in as I went, which are:
- Use regex to split in between \n##
- Consider whether I should keep or append the guide title and description so the system knows which context it is pulling from
- Consider any safety guards

**2.** I asked Claude to run the questions for me and compare different thresholds, top-k, and other specs so I did not have to run them manually.

# Unit 2

<!-- These sections get ADDED to what's already above. Don't delete or rewrite
     unit 1 — the point is that someone can see what you said before you knew
     how it went. -->

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Your five criteria, three runs each. `python run_eval.py --label before`
     runs the questions, puts the OUT_OF_SCOPE ones through the gate, and
     writes it all into results/ for you. Targets come from criteria.md; the
     verdict column is your call.

     Criterion 3 is measured in one deterministic pass rather than three, so
     the same number goes in all three run columns. That's correct, not lazy.

     Milestone 1. -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

<!-- Underneath, paste the REAL output for each criterion from one of your
     runs — the actual text your system produced, not a description of it.
     Name the file and function that produced it. -->

## Verdicts

<!-- MET or MISSED for each of the five, against the target you wrote last
     unit — not a new one. Plus a sentence on how you decided. That sentence
     matters most where it was close.

     If your target said 4 of 5 and your runs came out 4, 3, 4, that's a MISS.
     The target has to hold, not show up occasionally.

     Milestone 2. -->

| # | Criterion | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |

## Diagnoses

<!-- For each miss: which stage caused it, and how. The stage alone isn't
     enough — you need the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis: "Question 3 didn't work."
     A diagnosis:     "Question 3 asks about laundry costs. The answer is in
                       one sentence that got split across two chunks, so
                       neither chunk on its own contains it."

     The five stages: loading → chunking → embedding → retrieval → generation.

     Look for a pattern. If three misses all ask about numbers, that's one
     problem, not three.

     Missed nothing? Say so, then say honestly whether your targets were set
     low, and which one you'd tighten and to what.

     Milestone 3. -->

## The Improvement

**What I changed:**

**Why I picked it:**

<!-- Connect it to a specific diagnosis above in one sentence. If you can't,
     you picked a fix because it sounded impressive. -->

### Run Log — After

<!-- Same format, same five criteria, three runs each.
     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

**Did it help?**

<!-- Say plainly whether it did, and how you know. If it made things worse,
     say that — a change that backfired, honestly reported, earns full credit
     and is more interesting than one that worked. What matters is that you can
     tell.

     Milestone 4. -->

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed after your fix: what you'd do about it,
     and why you stopped where you did.

     "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is left is
     not.

     Milestone 5. -->

## What I'd Do Differently

<!-- Knowing what you know now — which of your five criteria would you write
     differently, and why?

     Milestone 5. -->
